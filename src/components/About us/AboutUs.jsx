        <p>A Serving Heart was co-founded by two women that had previously met on a mission trip in Haiti in 2008 and who became united in their hearts
          to become one heart dedicated to help serve the Haitian people who God put  before them helping one life at a time.



          Julienne <span>LeBrun</span> who was born in Quebec, Canada and then lived in Maine, is a Tae Kwon Do Grand Master Instructor who owned and
          ran an academy of the Martial Arts. She eventually felt in her heart that as a single woman she would sell and leave all behind her and move full time to live in the Dominican
          Republic and be closer to the ministry work. She is also skilled in languages and speaks fluently French, English, Spanish, Creole and some Italian. Because of this ability,
          she also serves other groups â€‹who need her as an interpreter.</p>
